# 3d-game-with-neural-network

Simple 3d game build with pygame  with neural network.


git clone https://github.com/ZackPashkin/3d-game-with-neural-network.git

cd 3d-game-with-neural-network

python main.py

(In my case, I use anaconda environments. I created env for this project and set the python interpeter in vscode to python located in this env my python path is ~opt/anaconda3/envs/env_name/bin/python, your can differ)

 pygame 2.0.0 (SDL 2.0.12, python 3.8.5)

## This project is splitted to parts for simplicity. You can find code as it was developed. Each part can be runned independently from other parts.
